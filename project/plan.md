Project Plan
Abstract
The project aims to analyze and compare the winter and summer climate patterns in Milan using two datasets: one focusing on the winter thermal season and the other on the summer thermal season. 

Rationale
How many days during the winter season experience temperatures below the indoor comfort threshold (20 °C) and above the outdoor average temperature?
How many days during the summer season reach or exceed the threshold for physiological discomfort?

Datasources
Datasource 1: Data on the climate of Milan — Winter thermal season
Metadata URL: https://data.europa.eu/en
Sample Data URL: https://dati.comune.milano.it/dataset/ef94c475-cb1a-4432-bd90-9cb3a739bd71/resource/b5a63c19-4a34-4ba0-8b49-04696372d8d2/download/ds1560_stagione_termica_invernale.csv
Data Type: CSV
Data Descriptions:
The data characterise the different areas of the city. The local differences are described through climate indicators related to 7 stations of Fondazione Osservatorio Meteorologico Milano Duomo appropriately located for the monitoring of temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind and radiation.
